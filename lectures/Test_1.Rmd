## Data Science Test 1

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Question 1
```{r}
## use a random number to randomize which title the scatter plot will get 
random.num <- runif(1, min=0, max=100)

scatter.it <- function(vector6, vector7) {
  ## combine both so that it makes a data set 
  combined <- c(vector6, vector7)
  if(random.num >= 50) {
    ggplot(combined, mapping = aes(vector6, vector7)) +
      geom_point() +
      ggtitle("Your data are beautiful!") 
  } else {
    ggplot(combined, mapping = aes(vector6, vector7)) +
      geom_point() +
      ggtitle("Your data are hideous!")
  }
}

```

## Question 2

```{r}

early.flights <- filter(flights, sched_dep_time > dep_time)
late.flights <- filter(flights, dep_delay <= 60)
really.late.flights <- filter(flights, dep_delay > 60)

flights %>%
  filter(origin == "BOS" | dest == "BOS") %>% ## get information about BOS 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(arr_time, dep_time)) +
  geom_point(data = early.flights, color = "green") +
  geom_point(data = late.flights, color = "blue") +
  geom_point(data = really.late.flights, color = "purple")



```


## Question 3

```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

```

July has the highest average departure delay, this can be due to the fact that it's the middle of summer and a lot of people tend to travel at the time because of the weather and vacations (both of parents and kids).

## Question 4

```{r}
flights %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(month)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(dep_delay), fill ="red") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,10))

```


## Question 5

```{r}
delta.flights <- 
  flights %>%
    filter(carrier == "DL")

## finding the successes with the departure delay being 5 minutes or less
delta.5.flights <- 
  delta.flights %>%
    filter(dep_delay >= 5)

mean(delta.flights$dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
## Based on data, average delay is 9 minutes
```

Hypothesis:
H0: p = 5, H1: p != 5

Test statistic:
Binomial Test

```{r}
## number of successes
hist(rbinom(10000, , 5))

#convert to proportion of successes
hist(rbinom(10000, 14, .75)/14)

# binom.test
binom.test(10, 14, .75)

## created two tail
pbinom(10, 14, .75)*2 

pnorm(.71, mean=.75, sd = sqrt(.75*.25/14))*2

```
