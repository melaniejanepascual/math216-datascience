```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# set up environment, declare variables, read data
library(ggplot2)

plants <- read.csv(file = "Plants.csv")
plants$Species <- factor(plants$Species)
plants$Fert <- factor(plants$Fert)
```


## Question 1
```{r}
table(plants$Species, plants$Fert)
```

Based on the table, the experimental design is reasonable becase there is an almost equal amount of the each fertilizer with each species

## Question 2

```{r}
ggplot(data = plants, mapping = aes(x = Species, y = BiomassT2)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```
